SqlLib
======

A small library I provide free of charge to anyone who might find it useful. Nothing in this library is particularly complex or hard to write, just time consuming; and very handy to have around.

The library is provided under the MIT License, so do with it as you please. I would however request that if you have any ideas for improvements, you either fork -> implement -> send pull request, or shoot me a message, and I'll see if I can implement it for you.

If you find the library useful please support by starring the repo and/or consider tipping me a beer or something through my website (http://bluewombat.com).

Good luck with it :-)
